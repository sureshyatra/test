# Laravel Locations v5 - Full package

Includes full code, per-table SQL files in database/sql/, a combined full_dump.sql, and Laravel seeders.

Import `database/sql/full_dump.sql` to get schema + sample data directly, or import per-table SQL files individually. You can also run `php artisan db:seed` after setting up the app.
